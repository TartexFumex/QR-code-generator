# QR Code Generator

This repository contains a Python script for generating customizable QR codes. The QR codes can include various features such as a specific shape, border, embedded images, and text. The final goal is to develop a similar solution for the web using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Customizable QR Code Shape**: Choose between square and ellipse shapes.
- **Border Customization**: Add borders with adjustable size, color, radius, and padding.
- **Embedded Images**: Embed an image in the center of the QR code.
- **Text Overlay**: Add custom text below the QR code with configurable font size, color, and background.

## Configuration

The script reads settings from a configuration file (`configuration.conf`). Below is an example of the configuration file:

## Usage
Install the required libraries:
pillow, numpy and qrcode

pip install pillow qrcode numpy
Ensure the configuration file configuration.conf is properly set up.
And run the script

## Future Development
The final goal is to create a similar solution for the web using JavaScript.
